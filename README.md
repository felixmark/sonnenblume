<h1>Welcome to Sunberry!</h1>
<p>
    This is a place, where you can program stuff on a solar-powered Raspberry Pi Zero 2 which will hopefully run 24/7.<br>
    You can just ask for ssh access!

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>#1: Programs must be written in Rust.</li>
        <li>#2: Only install (apt) packages you need and add them to the list of installed packages.</li>
        <li>#3: Keep constant CPU usage under 90%.</li>
        <li>#4: Document as much as possible.</li>
        <li>#5: Don't brick the system (please).</li>
        <li>#6: Don't do illegal stuff of any kind (of course).</li>
    </ul>
