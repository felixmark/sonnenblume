# Welcome to Sunberry!
This is a place, where you can program stuff on a solar-powered Raspberry Pi Zero 2 which will hopefully run 24/7.

## Rules
- #1: Programs must be written in Rust.
- #2: Only install (apt) packages you need and add them to the list of installed packages.
- #3: Keep constant CPU usage under 90%.
- #4: Document as much as possible.
- #5: Don't brick the system (please).
- #6: Don't do illegal stuff of any kind (of course).
